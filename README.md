**OVERVIEW:**
The front-end of the Real-Time Chat Application is developed using React. I focused on building dynamic components like chat rooms, message display areas, and user authentication interfaces. I used React Hooks for state management and implemented routing with React Router for seamless navigation. This project improved my skills in building interactive user interfaces, handling real-time data with React, and creating a smooth user experience through responsive design
